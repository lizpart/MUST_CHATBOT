# Enquiry Chatbot using Flask
This is an enquiry chatbot built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The chatbot is designed to provide answers to common questions related to a specific topic or domain, such as a student or persons who want information concerning Meru University of Science and Technology.

## Requirements
To run the chatbot, you'll need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Python 3.x
Flask (can be installed via pip)
Usage
To start the chatbot, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

## Copy code
`python main.py`
This will start a local server on your machine, which you can access in your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:5000.

Once you're on the chatbot page, you can begin typing in your questions and the chatbot will respond with the most relevant answer it can find. You can also add new questions and answers to the chatbot's knowledge base by editing the knowledge.json file in the project directory.

## Customization
To customize the chatbot's behavior or appearance, you can edit the code in the app.py file. For example, you might want to modify the chatbot's response logic or add more advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.

You can also modify the HTML and CSS in the templates and static directories, respectively, to change the look and feel of the chatbot interface.

## Conclusion
That's it! You now have a basic understanding of how the enquiry chatbot works using Flask. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to make it your own.
